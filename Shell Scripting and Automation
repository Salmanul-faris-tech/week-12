1. The Structure of a Shell Script
A standard shell script follows a specific anatomy:

The Shebang (#!): The very first line tells the system which interpreter to use.

Example: #!/bin/bash

Comments: Use # to document what the script does.

Commands: The same commands you type in the terminal (ls, mkdir, cp).

Permissions: For a script to run, it must have "execute" permissions (e.g., chmod +x myscript.sh).

2. Variables: Storing Data
Variables allow you to store information like filenames, dates, or user input to reuse throughout the script.

Defining: NAME="Gemini" (Note: No spaces around the =)

Accessing: Use the $ sign to call it.

Example: echo "Hello $NAME"

3. Conditional Statements (If/Else)
Conditionals allow your script to make decisions based on specific criteria.

Bash

if [ -f "config.txt" ]; then
    echo "File exists, proceeding..."
else
    echo "Error: config.txt is missing!"
    exit 1
fi
The [ -f ] flag checks if a file exists.

4. Loops: Repeating Tasks
Loops are the heart of automation. They allow you to perform the same action on dozens of files at once.

For Loop: Iterates over a list.

Example: Creating 5 backup folders.

Bash

for i in {1..5}; do
    mkdir "backup_$i"
done
While Loop: Runs as long as a condition is true.

5. Putting it All Together: An Automation Example
Imagine you want to back up a log file only if it is larger than 1MB. A simple script would look like this:

Bash

#!/bin/bash

# 1. Define variables
SOURCE="/var/log/syslog"
DEST="/home/user/backups"

# 2. Check if backup directory exists
if [ ! -d "$DEST" ]; then
    mkdir -p "$DEST"
fi

# 3. Automation Logic: Copy and Rename
TIMESTAMP=$(date +%F)
cp "$SOURCE" "$DEST/syslog_$TIMESTAMP.bak"

echo "Backup completed on $TIMESTAMP"
How to Execute a Script
Create: nano myscript.sh

Make Executable: chmod +x myscript.sh

Run: ./myscript.sh
